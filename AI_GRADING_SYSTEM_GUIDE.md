# AI Grading System - Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

The AI Grading System is a comprehensive, intelligent evaluation framework that provides context-aware assessment with unlimited attempts, detailed feedback, and progressive learning support. Built with Gemini AI integration, it evaluates student responses across multiple dimensions and provides actionable feedback for continuous improvement.

## Core Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Context-Aware Evaluation**

- **Domain Validation**: Ensures responses address the correct assignment domain
- **Milestone-Specific Assessment**: Evaluates understanding within the context of specific milestones
- **Concept Alignment**: Validates that responses align with expected concepts and requirements

### ðŸ”„ **Unlimited Attempts with Progressive Feedback**

- **No Attempt Limits**: Students can attempt milestones as many times as needed
- **Progressive Guidance**: Feedback becomes more specific and detailed with each attempt
- **Improvement Tracking**: System tracks improvement patterns and adapts feedback accordingly

### ðŸ“Š **Multi-Dimensional Scoring**

- **Context Relevance (40% weight)**: How well the response addresses the assignment context
- **Understanding Depth (35% weight)**: Depth and accuracy of understanding demonstrated
- **Completeness (25% weight)**: Coverage of key requirements and expected concepts

### ðŸ”’ **Smart Milestone Management**

- **Completion Locking**: Prevents re-answering after successful completion
- **Automatic Unlocking**: Next milestones unlock automatically when prerequisites are met
- **Dependency Validation**: Ensures prerequisite milestones are completed before proceeding

- **excellent**: final_score >= 85
- **good_progress**: final_score 70-84
- **needs_improvement**: final_score 50-69
- **context_mismatch**: context_relevance_score < 60
- **incomplete_understanding**: understanding_depth_score < 50
- **poor**: final_score < 50
