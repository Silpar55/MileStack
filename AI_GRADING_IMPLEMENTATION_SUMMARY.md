- **Failure Prevention**: Automatic failure if context relevance < 60, regardless of other scores

### ✅ **Unlimited Attempts with Progressive Feedback**

- **Implementation**: No attempt limits in database schema or API logic
- **Progressive Feedback**: Feedback becomes more specific and detailed with each attempt
- **Adaptive Guidance**: System provides hints and suggestions based on attempt number

### ✅ **Detailed, Actionable Feedback**

- **Multi-dimensional Feedback**: Separate feedback for context, understanding, and completeness
- **Specific Suggestions**: Concrete, actionable improvement recommendations
- **Encouragement**: Supportive tone with recognition of progress and effort

### ✅ **Prevention of Re-answering Completed Milestones**

- **Implementation**: `isLockedAfterCompletion` flag in database schema
- **API Validation**: Checkpoint API validates completion status before processing
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages when attempting completed milestones

### ✅ **Both Practical and Theoretical Answers Accepted**

- **Implementation**: Grading logic explicitly accepts both approaches
- **Context Awareness**: Evaluation focuses on contextual relevance regardless of approach
- **Flexible Assessment**: System adapts to different learning styles and response types

### ✅ **Intelligent Point Awarding and Milestone Progression**

- **Implementation**: Automatic point awarding upon successful completion
- **Progressive Unlocking**: Next milestones unlock automatically when prerequisites met
- **Smart Dependencies**: System validates and manages milestone prerequisites

## 📊 **Grading Algorithm**

### **Scoring Formula**

```
final_score = (context_relevance_score × 0.4) +
              (understanding_depth_score × 0.35) +
              (completeness_score × 0.25)
```

### **Pass/Fail Criteria**

- **Pass**: `final_score >= 70` AND `context_relevance_score >= 60`
- **Fail**: `final_score < 70` OR `context_relevance_score < 60`

### **Feedback Types**

- **outstanding**: final_score >= 95
- **excellent**: final_score >= 85
- **good_progress**: final_score 70-84
- **needs_improvement**: final_score 50-69
- **context_mismatch**: context_relevance_score < 60
- **incomplete_understanding**: understanding_depth_score < 50
- **poor**: final_score < 50

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Integration**

- **Enhanced Schema**: 44 new columns across 3 tables
- **Performance Optimization**: 8 new indexes for optimal query performance
- **Data Integrity**: 7 new constraints for validation
- **Analytics Support**: 7 new views for comprehensive reporting

### **API Architecture**
