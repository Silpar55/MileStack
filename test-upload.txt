Test Assignment

This is a sample programming assignment for testing the upload functionality.

Requirements:
1. Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number
2. Implement error handling for invalid inputs
3. Write unit tests for the function
4. Document the code with comments

The function should:
- Accept a positive integer as input
- Return the factorial of that number
- Handle edge cases like 0 and 1
- Throw an error for negative numbers

Example:
factorial(5) should return 120
factorial(0) should return 1
factorial(-1) should throw an error

This assignment tests understanding of:
- Functions and recursion
- Error handling
- Unit testing
- Code documentation
