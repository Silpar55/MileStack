# AI Grading Framework Enhancement

## Overview

The AI Grading Framework has been enhanced to support unlimited attempts, intelligent AI grading, user-customized milestones, and contextual evaluation. This comprehensive system provides detailed feedback, tracks learning progress, and adapts to individual student needs.

## Key Features

### 1. Unlimited Attempts System

- **No attempt limits**: Students can attempt milestones as many times as needed
- **Progress tracking**: Each attempt is tracked with detailed analytics
- **Improvement monitoring**: System tracks improvement from previous attempts
- **Learning pattern analysis**: Identifies learning patterns and adapts feedback

### 2. Intelligent AI Grading

- **Multi-dimensional scoring**: Context relevance, understanding depth, and completeness
- **Adaptive feedback**: Feedback adapts based on student's learning pattern
- **Concept identification**: AI identifies concepts mentioned in student responses
- **Competency mapping**: Maps responses to specific competencies

### 3. User-Customized Milestones

- **Custom milestone creation**: Users can add their own milestones
- **Flexible milestone types**: Text, code, design, reflection, and analysis milestones
- **Custom instructions**: Users can provide specific instructions for milestones
- **Prerequisite management**: Milestones can have dependencies

### 4. Contextual Evaluation

- **Domain classification**: Assignments are classified by domain (web dev, OOP, etc.)
- **Context validation**: Responses are evaluated for context relevance
- **Expected concepts**: System tracks which concepts should be mentioned
- **Deliverable tracking**: Key deliverables are identified and tracked
